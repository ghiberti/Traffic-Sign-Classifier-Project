## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
---

This project contains code and media related to the "Finding lane lines on the road" project for Udacity Self Driving Car NanoDegree.

The goals / steps of this project were the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

Contents:
* Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that contains all the code written for the project
* /data - contains image files which were used during the project
* /examples - contains images used in writeup
* project_writeup.md - contains project pipeline summary and reflections on the project outcome
